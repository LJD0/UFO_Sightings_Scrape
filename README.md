# UFO Sightings

## Overview

This analysis was designed to take information about sightings of UFOs and display them on a dynamic web page, with filter criteria to narrow results.

## Results:

This html page contains a collection of UFO sightings within a set time frame. This data can be broken down by search criteria including; city, state, country, shape, and date.

    - Using the search to narrow down results:

### Summary:

    Overall the data collected is limited by being so small. expanding the dataset would allow for a better comprehension of the sightings of UFOs. The use of several boxes to input search criteria is a bit outdated as well. Being able to input all seach parameters into a single input box would add to a modern look to the page and simplify the search process. Also using user input as a parameter could be cumbersome as the shape, time, and date variables are so various that using prefilled selections in a dropdown menu would allow for better navigation of the table.
